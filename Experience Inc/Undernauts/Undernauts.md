**Undernauts: Labyrinth of Yomi** is a first-person dungeon crawler developed by [[Experience Inc.]] and published by [[Aksys Games]] in October 2021 for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch.
# Gameplay
After entering [[Yomi]], your entire crew gets wiped out by a mysterious [[Red Luci|girl in red]]. Your only escape route out of Yomi, the [[Chinowa Gate]], is seemingly sabotaged by [[Hideki Kuzedo|a man]] sending you messages on your portable radio. He tells you the only way to escape is to kill the 8 [[Sinners]].
## Navigating the Labyrinth
Like most 2D dungeon crawlers, you move through the labyrinth in a first-person view. As you travel through the labyrinth, a map of every zone will be filled out for you automatically. You can view a full-size version of the map, and you can automatically travel through already-explored areas by selecting a cell on the map.
## Flowers Reveal the Way
As the game progresses and the Sinners are defeated, more zones are unlocked, and more tools (called [[Yomi Flowers]]) become available. The explorable areas are filled with obstacles that can only be traversed with these flowers. For example, there are many hidden paths behind walls that can only be revealed with the [[Door Flower]]. Many chasms can only be traversed by building a bridge with the [[Bridge Flower]]. 
## Creating Your Team
You can create a team of six [[Undernaut|Undernauts]] to fill out your crew. Each Undernaut starts with a default profile, with each profile providing a unique piece of artwork to represent them. After picking a profile for your Undernaut, you can change their name, nickname, and backstory to whatever you prefer.

After settling on your Undernaut's profile, you can choose a background and a job. Your Undernaut's background determines their base stats. There are six backgrounds to choose from: [[Youngster]], [[White-Collar]], [[Blue-Collar]], [[Athlete]], [[Creative]], and [[Vagabond]]. Jobs are your class, and they dictate what skills you will learn. There are eight jobs to choose from: [[Tactician]], [[Bulwark]], [[Fighter (Undernauts)]], [[Sorcerer]], [[Cleric]], [[Hunter]], [[Fencer]], and [[Ninja]].
## Fusion Reactors
Items and Yomi Flowers can be created at fusion reactors. Items are created with [[argen]], and Yomi Flowers are created with [[Flower Power]]. You can use the reactor to extract argen or Flower Power from an item, though the process of extraction consumes the item. Once you have extracted argen or Flower Power from an item, you can then create copies of it at the fusion reactor.
## Upgrading Gear
You can upgrade gear at the reactors, with each upgrade adding +1 to its name. Defeating Sinners and burning the [[relics]] they drop at the fusion reactor increases the upgrade capacity of the reactor, eventually allowing you to upgrade gear to +99.
# Combat
While in hostile areas outside of the camp, there are random encounters as well as field icons that trigger combat when touched. During combat, you will assign each character's actions for each round. Turns are taken in order based on various factors, including the character's speed and which action you chose. For example, [[Fencer|fencers]] have the skill [[Iai Slash]] which has a higher turn priority. [[Tactician|Tacticians]] have the skill [[Power Swing]] which has a significant turn delay.
## Boost System
Undernauts have been modified through technology to be superhumans. In combat, you will have access to three buffs called "[[boost|boosts]]" that last for a single round.
* [[Power Boost]] provides mana-free skill usage, and all skills used will be stronger.
* [[Dura Boost]] provides increased damage mitigation for your team, as well as immunity to status effects, instant kill magic, and [[kidnapping]].
* [[Neuro Boost]] provides increased turn priority for actions, buffs to [[speed]] and [[luck]], and gives a boost to experience earned at the end of combat if you use it on the final turn.
Boosts go on cooldown once you use them and will only recover by not using any boost for one round. When using multiple boosts in a row, they will recover in the order they were used.

## Loot
Some enemies will drop a chest full of loot when defeated. Chests may be boobytrapped, and you will have to disarm the trap in order to safely loot the chest. If you have a lockpick, the boobytraps can be opened safely for the cost of one lockpick. If you don't have a lockpick, you will instead have to guess what kind of trap the chest is boobytrapped with. Depending on how much mana your party has left, your guess will be more or less accurate. If your party has 100% of their mana, you will always be correct in your guess. The accuracy of the guess falls off the closer you approach 0% mana.

Random encounters will drop loot at random, but field symbol encounters are different. Green field symbols will never drop loot, but red symbols and [[MonFlower]] symbols will always drop loot.

# Plot
## Setting and characters
The setting is Tokyo, Japan circa 1979. 20 years before the start of the story, a mystical structure called Yomi appeared in place of one of the wards of Tokyo. Inside Yomi was a labyrinth full of monsters, but also vast amounts of resources, and a new energy source called [[argen]]. The discovery of argen resulted in a massive economic shift and rapid advancement in technology.

Companies dedicated to mining argen and other resources from Yomi appeared, and the workers who did the job of mining Yomi were called Undernauts -- humans who have been modified with argen-based technology to exhibit superhuman abilities.
## Story
You are the [[Mining Section Chief]] for [[Cassandra, Co.]], a small mining firm. Your company accepts a job to investigate the newly discovered [[District 99]] of Yomi for a large sum of money. Due to lack of funding, your company resorts to hiring untrained Undernauts using black market tactics, using candy shops as interviewing stations for women and students.

Upon entering District 99, your crew is killed and eaten in an attack by a girl in red. You make your way back to base camp to find the fusion reactor powering the [[Chinowa Gate]], your only escape from Yomi, is malfunctioning. Your supervisor, [[Hanba]], advises you to make your way to Camp 2 and rendezvous with the Undernaut company there to find a way to escape Yomi. At this point you can create your party of six Undernauts. You also receive a Door Flower, a tool that can reveal hidden paths in Yomi.

When you arrive at Camp 2, you find it littered with the mutilated corpses of the Undernauts that were stationed there. The fusion reactor is also malfunctioning, leaving you with no apparent means of escaping Yomi. At the edge of the camp, you find a pile of corpses of Undernauts from the [[Yomiten]] corporation, a major mining company with over twice the staff as yours. Though you find no surviving Undernauts, you do find a hooded, bandaged girl in a wheelchair. Though she says some strange things, you decide to take her back to Camp 1 for her own protection. On the way to Camp 1, she reveals she is blind, unable to walk, and has lost her memories, though she mentions having a "cursed power."

After returning to Camp 1, she immediately moves to the fusion reactor, calling it the "[[Mad King]]'s [[Spirit Tree]]" and suggesting she will fulfill her role as the "Spirit Tree's [[sacrifice]]." She also reveals her name is "[[Luci]]." She then spreads bloods from a wound on her arm onto the fusion reactor, which reactivates it. 

Noticing the fusion reactor is active, Supervisor Hanba attempts to reconnect the Chinowa Gate so you can escape from Yomi. The gate opens momentarily, but then disappears again. At the same time, a man begins broadcasting a message to your portable radio. He tells you he is responsible for the gate not working. He tells you that the 8 Sinners are responsible for wiping out Camp 2, and that they will come to wipe out Camp 1 soon, unless you wipe them out first.

Before leaving Camp, you speak with Luci. She tells you she has blessed everyone at the camp with the [[Blessing of Regeneration]]. She explains that the fusion reactors are capable of granting miracles in exchange for a powerful sacrifice. She asks you to bring her the souls of the Sinners, so she can sacrifice them to the Spirit Tree in exchange for a miracle to escape from Yomi.
