There are 3 playstyles.
They determine [[level growth caps]] and [[map functions]].
# Type A (Carefree Style)
The level growth cap is higher in Type A, so you can gain more levels in dungeons.

You can also use the mini-map and full dungeon map from the beginning.

You cannot change your style from Type A after the game has started.
# Type B (Standard Style)
The default style.

You can use the mini-map from the outset. However, other conditions must be met before you can use the full dungeon map.

You cannot change from Type B to Type C after the game has started.
# Type C (Challenging Style)
"A more nerve-racking style of dungeon exploration than Type B."

Level growth caps are lower than Type B. You can't gain many levels in dungeons.

Also, until certain conditions are met, you cannot use the mini map or the full dungeon map.

You can change from Type C at any point.
