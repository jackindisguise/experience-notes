[[Tir na Balc]], where [[fairies]] live, the land of swords and sorcery.

In this land stood the [[Dragon King's Tower]] [[Yggdran]], housing hidden [[treasures]] that could bring peace.

But one day, out of nowhere, the [[Seven Devil Kings]] stole all the hidden treasures.

Using the treasures' power to rule over [[demons]], they transformed the tower into a [[terrible dungeon]].

If they are left unchecked, the fairies' land will be destroyed.

So, to recover the treasures, I invited Otherworld adventurers bearing the qualities of a hero to my kingdom.

I'm sure they can defeat the Devil Kings.

So, please everyone: lend me your power.

Now is when we need the power of a [[Band of Heroes]].

Come, pray with me.

I pray that great fortune and glory will rest upon you. You, who have been guided to Tir na Balc.
