# Replacing Zhao
Zhao is trash. I dunno why the [[Warrior]] class is so useless, but I replaced him with a [[Fighter (Monyuu)|Fighter]].

>The heroes recovered one of the stolen [[Clanniebe|Hidden Treasures]], [[Mjolnir]]!

Devil Kings can be re-fought to get a new evaluation.

Eternia:
>This Hidden Treasure, [[Mjolnir]], is known as The God's Pickaxe.
>A god in dragon form once used Mjolnir. It gouged the earth and smashed mountains. That was how the Land of Fairies was made.
>I shall grant you a fraction of that miraculous power.

>...O Eternal Intercessor, Dragon King...
>...The power of creation, hidden in the treasure thou entrusted to me...
>...Bestow unto these braves whom I have acknowledged...
>Shine light upon these heroes!

Received [[Mjolnir|Mjolnir's Power]] from the Queen!

By Hidden Treasure Mjolnir's power, the 2nd level, [[Beastheim]], has been opened!
