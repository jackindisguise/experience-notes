# Replacing Zhao
Zhao is trash. I dunno why the [[Warrior]] class is so useless, but I replaced him with a [[Fighter (Monyuu)|Fighter]].

>The heroes recovered one of the stolen [[Clanniebe|Hidden Treasures]], [[Mjolnir]]!

Devil Kings can be re-fought to get a new evaluation.

Eternia:
>This Hidden Treasure, [[Mjolnir]], is known as The God's Pickaxe.
>A god in dragon form once used Mjolnir. It gouged the earth and smashed mountains. That was how the Land of Fairies was made.
>I shall grant you a fraction of that miraculous power.

>...O Eternal Intercessor, Dragon King...
>...The power of creation, hidden in the treasure thou entrusted to me...
>...Bestow unto these braves whom I have acknowledged...
>Shine light upon these heroes!

Received [[Mjolnir|Mjolnir's Power]] from the Queen!

Growth level cap increases to 7.

By Hidden Treasure Mjolnir's power, the 2nd level, [[Beastheim]], has been opened!

Chuck:
>This is the dungeon of beasts, [[Beastheim]]. [[Devil King]] [[Fenrir]] is the one who rules here.

>I remember the [[Holy Knight Sieg|Holy Knight]] saying there are [[hidden doors]] everywhere.

Walls with lanterns hanging from them often hide things, like doors and [[Scarab Beetles]].

Chuck:
>The [[Holy Knight Sieg]] is the proudest knight I know!
...
>He's the one who taught me the history of the [[Yggdran|Dragon King's Tower]].
...
>However, the Holy Knight went missing during his adventure in the tower.
...
>Even though the Queen told me to forget about him, I believe we'll meet again! Oink!

Kinda sus.

Mimijii:
>Since long ago, the [[Mimic Clan]] has had but a single job.
>To procure materials for the construction of the tower, and to govern it well.

Probably [[Holy Knight Sieg]] encountered in Beastheim:
>AAH... GAH... URRRRGGGHHHH...

>W-who are...you...?
>It couldn't be... New... heroes?

>I don't want...to hurt you...

Probably being mind-controlled. Probably by Eternia.

After defeating Sieg:
>I can't die yet...
>I haven't fulfilled my duty...

Find [[Curious Clover|4 leaf clover]] that grants the [[power of miracles]] according to Momijii.

It took my MP when I touched it. 👍

Chuck says the Queen said Sieg was [[Charm|charmed]]
by the powers of darkness. Very likely the same power as the Lich from Entaku no Seito and Undernauts.
