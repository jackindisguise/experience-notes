# Start of Game
[[Chuck]] wakes you up in the [[Hero Guild]].

Chuck: It's the day when heroes can meet the [[Eternia]] who rules the Fae Village, [[Einheim]].

You can create new heroes in the Registry -> 
Registration.
You can add created heroes to your party in Registry -> Create Team.

You go meet the queen, [[Eternia]].
# Meeting the Queen
The Queen implores you to venture into [[Yggdran]] and defeat the Seven Devil Kings to save the Land of Faeries.

Queen: To increase their own power, each took one piece of the [[Clanniebe|Hidden Treasure]] [[Clanniebe]].

She gives you the [[Hero Crest]], which proves you are chosen by her.

"With Queen Eternia's permission, the 1st level, [[Demiheim]], has been opened!"

Chuck: "Demiheim is ruled by a [[therianthrope]] - a [[beastman]] - Devil King named [[Freyr]]."
# Entering Yggdran
[[Mimijii]] is encountered in [[Demiheim]].

Mimijii: "The skull-shaped symbols are [[enemy emblems]]. Coming in contact with one will trigger a battle."

Mimijii: "An orange emblem will not move from its place."

Mimijii: "A green emblem will move freely."

Purple emblems will chase you and are very strong.

~~Blue emblems are Mimic clan members?~~

Blue emblems will run away from you and give lots of experience when defeated.

Ukabu is the boss of the first level.

After defeating Ukabu, a [[Map Beetle|strange bug]]
appears and reveals the map???

Mimijii explains that it's a Map Beetle.

Mimijii: "Freyr lives around here. He's the boss of the [[Goblins]] and the [[Harpies]]."

Advice against Freyr:
- He's very nimble, so normal attacks won't hit him.

Mimijii:
>We, the mimic clan, who manage this tower, will take you outside ourselves.

He's part of the Mimic clan.
