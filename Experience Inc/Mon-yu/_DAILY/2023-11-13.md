[[Chuck]] wakes you up in the [[Hero Guild]].

Chuck: It's the day when heroes can meet the [[Eternia]] who rules the Fae Village, [[Einheim]].

You can create new heroes in the Registry -> 
Registration.
You can add created heroes to your party in Registry -> Create Team.

You go meet the queen, [[Eternia]].

The Queen implores you to venture into [[Yggdran]] and defeat the Seven Devil Kings to save the Land of Faeries.

Queen: To increase their own power, each took one piece of the [[Hidden Treasure]] [[Clanniebe]].

She gives you the [[Hero Crest]], which proves you are chosen by her.

"With Queen Eternia's permission, the 1st level, [[Demiheim]], has been opened!"

Chuck: "Demiheim is ruled by a [[therianthrope]] - a [[beastman]] - Devil King named [[Freyr]]."

[[Mimijii]] is encountered in Demiheim.

Mimijii: "The skull-shaped symbols are [[enemy emblems]]. Coming in contact with one will trigger a battle."

Mimijii: "An orange emblem will not move from its place."

Mimijii: "A green emblem will move freely."
