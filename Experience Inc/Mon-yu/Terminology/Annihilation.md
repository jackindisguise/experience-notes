When all heroes [[withdraw]] or are dead, they are 
annihilated. After annihilation, your party will be brought back to the village with these two [[blessings]].
# HP and MP Increase
Maximum HP and MC will be raised slightly. However, there's a limit on how much they can be raised. The limit increases as you progress through the game.
# Experience Conversion
This occurs when a hero's level reaches its [[growth limit]]. A certain percentage of experience gained after hitting the limit is converted into gold.
