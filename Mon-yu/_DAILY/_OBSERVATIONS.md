# Sieg is fighting mind control.
Sieg has been mind-controlled by something and is fighting against it.

In his more lucid state, his goal is to stop people from retrieving the treasures. It might intuitively seem like this means he's trying to defend the Devil Kings, but my guess is his real reason is to stop Eternia from regaining her full power.

The fact that Sieg is still alive but Eternia told Chuck to "forget about him" reads to me that Eternia has abandoned Sieg because he is no longer useful or she can no longer control him. It's not that Sieg is beyond saving from the clutches of evil. Even if he was, why would you treat him like he's already dead? You'd surely want to save him if you could.

My guess is that Sieg, as well as the heroes, were mind-controlled by Eternia into collecting the [[Clanniebe|Seven Hidden Treasures]]. Probably to get her powers back, which were stolen by the [[Devil Kings|Seven Devil Kings]]. My guess is that the final [[Devil Kings|Devil King]] will be very revealing -- possibly a fairy or a human who betrayed or defeated Eternia in one way or another.

Eternia reveals that [[Laevateinn]] gave the fairies the power to fight the demons, but adds the caveat that they're still weaker than the heroes. This might be true, though my guess is it isn't.

If Laevateinn gave the fairies the power to defeat the demons, why aren't the fairies defeating the demons? Maybe Eternia is a demon, and we're killing the fairies?
