## What is Clanniebe?
[[Clanniebe]] is **the** Hidden Treasure, but it was split into the [[Clanniebe|Seven Hidden Treasures]] at some point in the past. It seems the Seven Hidden Treasures were fundamentally related to the creation of the world (at least "[[Tir na Balc|this world]]").
## What is the Dragon King?
I believe [[Eternia]] talks about the Dragon King as basically the creator deity of at least "this world."

I think this essentially means [[Yggdran]] is actually the Dragon King's body.
# Who has the Charm power?
My guess is it's Eternia, but we'll see. Eternia told [[Chuck]] that [[Sieg]] was charmed by the dark side, and to forget about him (which is a little sus).
