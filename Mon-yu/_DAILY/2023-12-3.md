# Exploring Vanheim (cont.)
Collected all 5 chalices. Honestly the most frustrating and stupid areas I've ever had to explore. Very dumb and annoying. It was an attempt at the Philosopher's Tower from Undernauts. Just annoying.

Defeated [[Jormungandr]], which is just a clone of the [[Surtr]] fight. Two phases, during one phase you can't fight, during the other phase you have to use ranged/magic damage.
