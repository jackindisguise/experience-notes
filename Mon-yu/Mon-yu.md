# Plot
## Settings and characters
The [[Yggdran|Dragon King's Tower]], Yggdran, once housed [[Clanniebe|Seven Hidden Treasures]] that could bring peace. But one day, the [[Devil Kings|Seven Devil Kings]] stole the treasures and used their powers to turn Yggdran into a terrible dungeon.

You have been guided to [[Tir na Balc]], the land of the fairies. Chosen by the Queen of the Fairies, [[Eternia]], to defeat the [[Devil Kings|Seven Devil Kings]] and retrieve the Hidden Treasure [[Clanniebe]].

The Queen grants you her blessing using [[Secret Revival Magic]], allowing you the ability to resurrect endlessly as you explore the depths of [[Yggdran]].
# Gameplay
Most of the gameplay elements build on the improvements leading up to Undernauts, offering almost the exact same character creation system with the same classes and even the same skills and spells.
# Exploring Yggdran
Just like the [[Yomi Flowers]] present in Undernauts, the [[Clanniebe|Seven Hidden Treasures]] grant you new methods of exploring Yggdran, progressively unlocking hidden doors, the ability to build bridges, and so on.
