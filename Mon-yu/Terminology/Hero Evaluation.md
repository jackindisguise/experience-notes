Heroes are evaluated based on the evaluation criteria. An evaluation is made each time a goal set fo r the dungeon is completed. The evaluation does not affect story progression or completion of the [[Field Guide]], but you do get a reward for a high score. Note that the evaluation is the same for all playstyles.
# For a High Evaluation
The three points to keep in mind for the evaluation are:
* Defeat the [[Devil Kings|Devil King]] of the dungeon at a low level.
* Defeat the Devil King in a low number of turns.
* Explore all of the dungeon.
