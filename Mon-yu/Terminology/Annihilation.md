When all heroes [[withdraw]] or are dead, they are annihilated. After annihilation, your party will be brought back to life by [[Eternia]]'s [[Secret Revival Magic]] with these two [[Annihilation|Blessings]].
# HP and MP Increase
Maximum HP and MP will be raised slightly. However, there's a limit on how much they can be raised. The limit increases as you progress through the game.
# Experience Conversion
This occurs when a hero's level reaches its growth limit. A certain percentage of experience gained after hitting the limit is converted into gold.
