# Enhancement
More skills become available after gaining access to [[Job Enhancement]].
## Law
The Fighter gains access to infinite scaling with [[Whirlwind Qigong]], increased crowd control with [[Stunning Secrets]], and massive AoE damage with [[Cyclone Fist]].
## Chaos
Splitting focus into survival and utility, the Fighter gains access to Ninja, Warrior, Knight, and Cleric skills. With increased evasion from [[Cicada Shell Jutsu]], increased self-healing from [[Divine Regeneration]], death-defiance from [[True Grit]], and damage reduction from [[Defense Expertise]], Chaos Fighters seem to be the most survivable units.
