# Enhancement
More skills become available after gaining access to [[Job Enhancement]].
## Law
The Samurai becomes a much more effective damage dealer with [[Advancement - Dual Wield]], and gains potent self-healing with [[Bat Swipe]], healing off of the damage they deal.
## Chaos
The Samurai becomes somewhat of a Ninja-Warrior-Fighter-Samurai combination, becoming impossible to hit with [[Cicada Shell Jutsu]], [[Evasion Expertise]], and [[Illusion Jutsu]], and getting an extreme amount of free attacks with [[Follow-Up Strike]] and [[Butterfly & Bee]].
