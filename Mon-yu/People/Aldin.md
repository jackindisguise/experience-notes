Long ago, [[Aldin]] was defeated by heroes in the [[Otherworld]] and fled to [[Tir na Balc]], the land of the fairies. There he possessed [[Eternia]] due to her extreme magical power. His power began to fade, so he concocted a plan to use the [[Clanniebe|Seven Hidden Treasures]] to restore it. He used Eternia's power to summon heroes to assist him in defeating the [[Devil Kings|Seven Guardians of the Hidden Treasures]], telling them they were actually [[Devil Kings]] who had stolen the treasures for themselves.
# Holy Knight Sieg
Long ago, [[Holy Knight Sieg]] helped Eternia defeat the Devil Kings. However, the [[Merlin|God of Light]] intervened to inform Sieg about the truth of Eternia and her quest to collect the Seven Hidden Treasures. Sieg was granted a secret eighth [[Clanniebe|Hidden Treasure]] which granted him immortality but eventually drove him mad as he was not one of the [[True Heroes]]. He then roamed the [[Yggdran|Dragon King's Tower]], protecting the [[Clanniebe|Seven Hidden Treasures]] from any Hero who came to collect them.
