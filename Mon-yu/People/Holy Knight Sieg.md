Holy Knight Sieg was once Eternia's trusted confidant and a Hero of the realm. According to Eternia, at some point in the past, he was charmed by the powers of Darkness. When encountered in the [[Yggdran|Dragon King's Tower]], his primary goal is to stop you from collecting the [[Clanniebe|Seven Hidden Treasures]], making him a major antagonist.

For some reason, Sieg is able to resurrect without Eternia's [[Secret Revival Magic]]. Eternia gives you a dagger that can hopefully put a stop to his immortality.
# The Truth
Long ago, Sieg was summoned by Eternia as her chosen Hero to collect the Hidden Treasures. One day, he heard the voice of the [[Merlin|God of Light]], who warned him that the Seven Devil Kings were actually the chosen Guardians of the Hidden Treasures, and that Eternia had been charmed by the powers of darkness. Her only goal was to collect the Seven Hidden Treasures and resurrect the True Devil King, [[Aldin]]. The God of Light granted him the eighth Hidden Treasure, [[Einherjar]], which could resist the charm of darkness. Because the treasure did not choose Sieg, it slowly drove him mad. The treasure also granted him immortality, similar to the [[Secret Revival Magic]].
