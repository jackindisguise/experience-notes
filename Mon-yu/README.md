# Plot
## Setting and characters
The Dragon King's Tower, [[Yggdran]], once housed [[Clanniebe|Seven Hidden Treasures]] that could bring peace. But one day, the [[Devil Kings|Seven Devil Kings]] stole the treasures and used their powers to turn Yggdran into a terrible dungeon.

You have been guided to [[Tir na Balc]], the land of the fairies. Chosen by the Queen of the Fairies, [[Eternia]], to defeat the [[Devil Kings|Seven Devil Kings]] and retrieve the Hidden Treasure [[Clanniebe]].

The Queen grants you her blessing using [[Secret Revival Magic]], allowing you the ability to resurrect endlessly as you explore the depths of [[Yggdran]].
## Story
### History
Long ago, the primal God was separated into 3 forms: the God of Light, the God of Dark, and the Dragon King. While Light and Dark were in constant conflict, the Dragon King attempted to maintain a balance between the two forces. The God of Dark, represented by demons, had the upperhand. The humans, who represented the God of Light, were weak. To solve this imbalance, the Dragon King allowed the God of Light to grant men the power of the Cavalier.

The Dragon King created the land of the fairies, [[Tir na Balc]], as a place for defeated Kings and Gods to rest and regain their power. He erected a colossal tower called [[Yggdran]] where he left 8 [[Clanniebe|Hidden Treasures]] that could keep the peace in the land, and he left powerful [[Devil Kings|Guardians]] to watch over them.

When the Dragon King left, he ordered the fairies to protect the treasures and to pass on [[The Fairy Poem]].
### Before Mon-yu
Some time before Mon-yu began, the Great Devil King [[Aldin]] was defeated in [[another world]] and appeared in Tir na Balc. He was somehow able to possess [[Eternia]], and concocted a plan to restore his powers using the [[Clanniebe|Seven Hidden Treasures]]. He used Eternia's unique position to trick Heroes from other worlds to collect the hidden treasures for him.

At some point, Eternia's most trusted follower and strongest Hero, [[Holy Knight Sieg|Sieg]], received a message from the God of Light informing him of Aldin's influence on Eternia. The God of Light granted Sieg the 8th hidden treasure, [[Einherjar]], which granted him immortality and immunity to Aldin's power of [[Charm]]. Unfortunately, because Sieg was not chosen by the treasures, the power of [[Einherjar]] slowly drove him mad. He wandered the Dragon King's Tower with the only goal of protecting the [[Clanniebe|Seven Hidden Treasures]] from would-be Heroes sent by Eternia to collect them.
### Mon-yu
Heroes appear in Tir na Balc, Eternia tricks them into fighting the Devil Kings and collecting the Hidden Treasures. Sieg appears and tries to stop them, though is defeated multiple times. Eternia tries to come up with a way to stop his immortality.
# Gameplay
Most of the gameplay elements build on the improvements leading up to Undernauts, offering almost the exact same character creation system with the same classes and even the same skills and spells.
## Exploring Yggdran
Just like the [[Yomi Flowers]] present in Undernauts, the [[Clanniebe|Seven Hidden Treasures]] grant you access to various progression systems ranging from multi-classing your heroes, to revealing hidden doors in the dungeons.
## Creating Your Heroes
Character creation has been significantly simplified from even [[Undernauts - Labyrinth of Yomi/README|Undernauts]], getting ridding of backgrounds/races entirely. The only fundamental distinction between characters are their jobs (equivalent of class). Jobs determine your attributes and your skills.
## Playstyle
The game comes with 3 difficulty settings called "playstyles". The playstyles don't change the overall gameplay, but they do limit your access to useful features (maps), and they limit the maximum level of your characters during different sections of the game. If you're struggling on a harder difficulty, you can lower the difficulty.
### Playstyle A
- Level cap starts at 7.
- You start with full access to the minimap.
- You start with full access to the full map.
### Playstyle B
- Level cap starts at 5.
- You start with full access to the minimap.
- You start with no access to the full map and must find the map beetle to unlock it.
### Playstyle C
- Level cap starts at 3.
- You start with no access to the minimap and must find the map beetle to unlock it.
- You start with no access to the full map and must find the map beetle to unlock it.
## Progression Systems
### Upgrading Equipment
Unlike Undernauts, money is not used to upgrade equipment. Instead, while you gain experience from defeating enemies, your equipment is also gaining experience. This means that even though you can't level up your characters beyond a certain point (due to the level caps), you can still strengthen your character through their equipment.
### Skill Points
Also unlike Undernauts, you do not gain skill points by leveling up. You gain skill points independently from your level, giving you yet another progression system that bypasses the level cap.
# Combat
While in Yggdran, there are no random encounters, but there are field icons that trigger combat when touched. During combat, you will assign each character's actions for each round. Turns are taken in order based on various factors, including the character's speed and which action you chose. For example, [[Samurai (Mon-yu)|Samurai]] have the skill [[Swallow Slice]] which has a higher turn priority. [[Warrior (Mon-yu)|Warrior]] have the skill [[Deadly Blow]] which has a significant turn delay.
## Clan Skills
Clan skills are unlocked over the course of the game and provide access to abilities similar to [[Boosts]] from Undernauts.
* [[Clan Skill|Divine Protection]] provides increased damage mitigation for your team, as well as increased resistance to status effects.
* [[Clan Skill|Transcendence]] provides mana-free skill usage.
* [[Clan Skill|Boon]] provides increased turn priority for actions, buffs to hit and evasion rate, and if combat ends while this skill is active, you will gain double the treasure drops.
Clan skills go on cooldown for one turn after using them.
## Loot
All enemies drop loot after being defeated.
