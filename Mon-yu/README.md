# Plot
## Setting and characters
The Dragon King's Tower, [[Yggdran]], once housed [[Clanniebe|Seven Hidden Treasures]] that could bring peace. But one day, the [[Devil Kings|Seven Devil Kings]] stole the treasures and used their powers to turn Yggdran into a terrible dungeon.

You have been guided to [[Tir na Balc]], the land of the fairies. Chosen by the Queen of the Fairies, [[Eternia]], to defeat the [[Devil Kings|Seven Devil Kings]] and retrieve the Hidden Treasure [[Clanniebe]].

The Queen grants you her blessing using [[Secret Revival Magic]], allowing you the ability to resurrect endlessly as you explore the depths of [[Yggdran]].
## Story
### History
Long ago, the primal God was separated into 3 forms: the God of Light, the God of Dark, and the Dragon King. While Light and Dark were in constant conflict, the Dragon King attempted to maintain a balance between the two forces. The God of Dark, represented by demons, had the upperhand. The humans, who represented the God of Light, were weak. To solve this imbalance, the Dragon King allowed the God of Light to grant men the power of the Cavalier.

The Dragon King created the land of the fairies, [[Tir na Balc]], as a place for defeated Kings and Gods to rest and regain their power. He erected a colossal tower called [[Yggdran]] where he left 8 [[Clanniebe|Hidden Treasures]] that could keep the peace in the land, and he left powerful [[Devil Kings|Guardians]] to watch over them.

When the Dragon King left, he ordered the fairies to protect the treasures and to pass on [[The Fairy Poem]].
### Before Mon-yu
Some time before Mon-yu began, the Great Devil King [[Aldin]] was defeated in [[another world]] and appeared in Tir na Balc. He was somehow able to possess [[Eternia]], and concocted a plan to restore his powers using the [[Clanniebe|Seven Hidden Treasures]]. He used Eternia's unique position to trick Heroes from other worlds to collect the hidden treasures for him.

At some point, Eternia's most trusted follower and strongest Hero, [[Holy Knight Sieg|Sieg]], received a message from the God of Light informing him of Aldin's influence on Eternia. The God of Light granted Sieg the 8th hidden treasure, [[Einherjar]], which granted him immortality and immunity to Aldin's power of [[Charm]]. Unfortunately, because Sieg was not chosen by the treasures, the power of [[Einherjar]] slowly drove him mad. He wandered the Dragon King's Tower with the only goal of protecting the [[Clanniebe|Seven Hidden Treasures]] from would-be Heroes sent by Eternia to collect them.
### Mon-yu
Heroes appear in Tir na Balc, Eternia tricks them into fighting the Devil Kings and collecting the Hidden Treasures. Sieg appears and tries to stop them, though is defeated multiple times. Eternia tries to come up with a way to stop his immortality.
# Gameplay
Most of the gameplay elements build on the improvements leading up to Undernauts, offering almost the exact same character creation system with the same classes and even the same skills and spells.
# Exploring Yggdran
Just like the [[Yomi Flowers]] present in Undernauts, the [[Clanniebe|Seven Hidden Treasures]] grant you new methods of exploring Yggdran, progressively unlocking hidden doors, the ability to build bridges, and so on.
